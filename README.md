## Sales Territory Optimization Project
This project simulates a real-world sales optimization problem using machine learning and business analytics. It includes:

Propensity modeling to predict the likelihood of winning a deal

Profit cube logic to calculate deal-level profit

Optimization scoring to prioritize high-value sales leads

A sample dataset and fully reproducible Python code
